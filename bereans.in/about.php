        	<h3><a href="#" id="who">Who We Are</a></h3>
        	<p>
        	We are a group of believers who stand by the word of God without private interpretation, believing that the Holy Spirit teaches the things of Christ to all those who are willing to obey Him.We accept and acknowledge all disciples of Christ who are committed to obeying the word of God through the instruction of the Spirit of God irrespective of their denominational background. We seek to balance the practice of faith with the teaching of the Word of God. We obey God and pursue a good conscience without reference to denominational beliefs. With regard to debatable issues our stance is one of spiritual unity in major things, liberty in minor things, "agape" in all things.

    <h3><a href="#" id="what">What We Believe</a></h3>
 	<p>
 	We believe in one God, who made all things through his only Son, Jesus Christ, by the power of the Holy Spirit. God gave Jesus Christ who is God manifest in flesh to suffer death for the sin of all mankind, so that we might live eternally with him. We believe that the forgiveness of sins and the gift of the Holy Spirit is given freely to all who believe with all their heart that Jesus Christ as the one and only begotten Son of God, the radiance of God’s glory and the true and complete expression of his nature, to be obeyed, honored and worshipped as God Almighty. 
 	</p>
 	<p>
 	In accordance with the Word of God we believe that everyone who believes in Christ shows it by being identified with him in his suffering, death and resurrection through the spiritual act of baptism out of a believing heart. Baptism of the physical body saves no one. However, baptism of a convicted and repentant sinner in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ conveys the desire for identification with the Savior which is the root of salvation, and is that appeal to God by faith for a good conscience which is never refused. 
 	</p>
 	<p>
 	We believe that the Church is God’s program for God’s people, a gathered and willing community of saints without barriers of caste, denomination or race, gathered by the Spirit of God to be the dwelling place of God through his Spirit, to serve God in truth and in spirit rather than in word and through merely outward acts of worship. We believe the ministry of the Church involves and is mediated through the powerful gifts of the Holy Spirit which are given to the saints in every city for the edification of the Body of Christ in that place. We believe in the submission of the saints in every city to the elders appointed for that city. We believe that the mission of the Church to make disciples of all nations will be best fulfilled when God’s people live together in love and unity as one people in Christ, holding steadfastly to the apostles’ teaching and in prayer, fellowship in all spiritual and material blessings, and breaking of bread in simplicity and the pure remembrance of our Lord Jesus Christ who is our life and our hope of glory.
